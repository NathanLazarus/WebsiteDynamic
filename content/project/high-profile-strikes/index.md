title: High Profile Strikes Dataset

The High Profile Strikes Dataset (HPSD) is a coding of press reports catalogued in the “World Publications” section of the Nexis database pertaining to economic and political trade union protest. In the original dataset, the stories were identified by using broade search terms like "labor," "strikes," and "industrial disputes" and included protest from non-OECD countries for the period 1980 to 2005.

      Wages and the Value of Nonemployment
    </div>

    
      <div class="article-candy">
        <details> <summary style=color:blue>Abstract (click to expand)</summary> Nonemployment is often posited as a worker’s outside option in wage-setting models such as bargaining and wage posting. The value of nonemployment is therefore a key determinant of wages. We measure the wage effect of changes in the value of nonemployment among initially employed workers. Our quasi-experimental variation in the value of nonemployment arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit changes; point estimates imply a wage response of less than $0.01 per $1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than $0.03. The insensitivity holds even among workers with low wages and high predicted unemployment duration, and among job switchers hired out of unemployment. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value presents a puzzle to the widely used Nash bargaining model, which predicts a sensitivity of $0.24–$0.48. Our evidence supports wage-setting models that insulate wages from the value of nonemployment. </details> <em> <font size="3.5"> <strong>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</strong>, Volume 135, Issue 4, November 2020, Pages 1905–1963. </font> </em>

The new version of the dataset builds on the earlier version while also expanding the number of sources (e.g. moving beyond just Nexis). I am also looking for ways to make the database open-source, i.e. to allow individual researchers to contribute codings of strike events and to suggest corrections to earlier codings.
