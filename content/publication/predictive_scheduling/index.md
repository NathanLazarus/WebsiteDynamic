abstract: We study the consequences of predictive scheduling laws for wages, emmployment, hours, and the variability of hours worked. A number of states and municipalities have recently passed these laws, which require employers to give their employees advance notice before of their schedules. We are interested in both the first stage, whether these laws succeed in making worker schedules more predictable, as well as the downstream consequences for wages, total employment and hours. We use the industry-specific nature of the laws in a difference-in-differences design. We have preliminary results from the wage files of Oregon Employment Department, and find no effect of the law on these aggregate quantities. We are developing a model to understand why firms would desire to offer unpredictable schedules, in response to unpredictable demand, and how much of a compensating differential workers would be paid.
