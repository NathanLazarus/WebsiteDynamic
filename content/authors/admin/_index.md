I study labor economics, focusing on wage setting, labor market institutions, and imperfect competition in labor markets. I work for Simon Jäger as a research assistant at the Massachusetts Institutute of Technology and the Institute for Labor Economics (IZA). Previously, I worked as a research assistant for Mordecai Kurz and Kenneth Judd at Stanford University. I am also interested in topics in development economics and public finance.
